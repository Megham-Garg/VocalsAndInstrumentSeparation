# Vocals and Instrument Separation

This repository contains code and resources for vocals and instrument separation using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

In music production and audio processing, vocals and instrument separation is a challenging task. The goal is to separate the vocals (singing voice) from the accompanying instruments in a music recording. This can be useful for various applications such as remixing, karaoke, and audio analysis.

This project aims to explore different approaches and algorithms for vocals and instrument separation, leveraging machine learning techniques and signal processing methods.

## Features

- Dataset preparation and preprocessing
- Training and evaluation of separation models
- Implementation of various separation algorithms
- Evaluation metrics for assessing separation performance
- Example applications and demos
